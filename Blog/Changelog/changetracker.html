        <h1>Tracking my learning and changes made to this website.</h1>
        <p> So, this website is getting kind of big, and so this requires a bit more management on my end. <br/>
        this page is going to serve as a linear change log, progress tracker, and goal setter.</p>

        <h3>August 15th 2023, Independence day</h3>
        <p> Firstly, Idk what India was thinking when we got out <i>independence</i> from the British - we as a nation have squandered the opportunities we got and had. <br/>
        BUT, so far this website has got my resume on it, two different blogs, a page for my projects, AND I have stylized some of the pages. <br/>
        Pretty ok progress I'd say, but there a long way to go. I'd like to set some goals for myself for additions. <br/>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Stylize the pages better, the color schemes suck and are all over the place! I have made external style sheets, but they could use some work and thought</li>
            <li> I <i>should</i> make a forum, where people can submit messages to me - this could be suggestions on the website or maybe just a "hi". Though, I don't have much traffic on my website lol... :( </li>
            <li> I also <i>should</i> start updating my projects page with some htmls of the knitted projects from Rstudio or python.</li>
        </ol>

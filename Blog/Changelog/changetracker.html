<h1>Change Log</h1>
<h3 class="desc">Updates to <a href="https://slightlyhappy.github.io/">slightlyhappy.github.io</a></h3>
<br/>
<p class = "para"> The website is getting kind of big, and will require a bit more management on my end. <br/>
        This page is going to serve as a linear-chronological change log, progress tracker, and goal setter.</p>

<h3 class = "date"> May 20 2024, "Changes and maturity(?)"<br></h3>
<li class="update">I needed a change.</li>
<li class = "update">It's been a while since I've had time to work on this website. </br> Ok, so what needs to be done... </br> First off the Blog section needs to be cleaned, make it look more professionally put together. I also want to start regularly writing for this. The photos sections need to be merged and a better gallery needs to be made - perhaps one sorted by Date. Music (there was one suggestion for that... but lets see, I don't think music would be that nice an addition - maybe some feedback sounds on clicking...)  ) </li>

<h3 class = "date"> August 18th 2023, "It is coming together"<br></h3>
<li class="update">God damn, coding the photo-not-by-me section and the photo-blog main page too a motherfucking minute. I shit you not, I couldn't sleep cus it was a simple problem to solve but I was unable to work my way around it.</li>
<li class = "update">But, whatever, I got done what needed to be done. Onwards so that I can <i>finally</i> start uploading some data analysis projects. Though I will say this is good practice for publishing papers, blogs, whatever online.</li>


<h3 class="date"> August 17th 2023, Lotta work day?April 13th 2016<br></h3>
<li class="updates">Wow, the beautification project really took a minute, but... Now I have a slideshow on my index page, it isn't that boring and I can add more sections to my not-so-shitty website now! </li>
<li class="updates">Onwards little man!</li>


<h3 class="date">August 16th, 2023, The day after Independence day<br></h3>
<li class="updates">Ok, I did it again I stayed up all night doing what I like to do <i> Tinkering</i>.</li>
<li class="updates">But I did cross of one thing from the changelog list I made yesterday. I updated my Resume page and the stylistic elements.I should go to sleep it's 3 am and I want to wake up early to workout tomorrow. Smh why can I not just stay awake forever (shh... I know the answer to why I can't, I'm complaining for the hell of it)</li>



<h3 class="date">August 15th 2023, Independence day<br></h3>
<p class="para"> Firstly, Idk what India was thinking when we got out <i>independence</i> from the British - we as a nation have squandered the opportunities we got and had. <br/>
        BUT, so far this website has got my resume on it, two different blogs, a page for my projects, AND I have stylized some of the pages. <br/>
        Pretty ok progress I'd say, but there a long way to go. I'd like to set some goals for myself for additions.
<li class="updates">Stylize the pages better, the color schemes suck and are all over the place! I have made external style sheets, but they could use some work and thought</li>
<li class="updates">I <i>should</i> make a forum, where people can submit messages to me - this could be suggestions on the website or maybe just a "hi". Though, I don't have much traffic on my website lol... :( </li>
<li class = "updates">I also <i>should</i> start updating my projects page with some htmls of the knitted projects from Rstudio or python.</li>
<li class = "updates"> Add a footer to subpages that links back to the home page : this is done by adding a css section with a div class "footer" -- you'll figure it out. </li>

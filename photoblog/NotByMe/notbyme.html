<p> So there is a floder on my phone called art and asthetics; mainly just a collection of art that looks good as wallpapers. 
    <br> Imma start with that for this blog, and for now this will serve as practise for alignment and sourcing images - later I might improve the organization and rework the website. </br>
    <i> also note that I don't have the refernces/credits for the artists, sorry about that - but I am sure a tech savvy person can reverse image search for the source and credits. </i>
</p>

<p> Ok, while I can place images in the middle, beginning or inside a paragraph - I think I will stick to some simple formatting, including the images at the beginning of a paragpah (that is if I add one) </p>

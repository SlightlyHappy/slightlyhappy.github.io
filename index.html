    <h1> Welcome to <s>my website</s> ... whatever this is </h1>
    <p> You may have noticed the grandiose title for this site, I hope to live up to it. If I don't, understand that learning on your own is often brimmed with distractions. </p>

    <dl>
        <dt> <a href = "practice/practice.html">Practice </a></dt>
        <dd> Just some space for me to throw elements, attributes, code, pretty much <i>things</i> against the wall, see what it looks like</dd>
        <dt><a href = "projects/projects.html"> Projects </a></dt>
        <dd> Don't bother clicking on this yet, I am still working on it...</dd>
        <dt> <a href = "photoblog/photob.html"> Photo Blog </a></dt>
        <dd> A little blog for photos that I find interestingm, or ones that I have clicked. </dd>

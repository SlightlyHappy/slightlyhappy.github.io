    <h1> Welcome to my website </h1>
    <p> You may have noticed the grandiose title for this site, I hope to live up to it. If I don't, understand that learning on your own is often brimmed with distractions. </p>
    <p> Now, before I practise any other html element or element attributes, I'd like to segment away from this <i> main </i> page to sub pages - simply because I'd rather be organized <br> let's make a practice folder and link it: </br> </p>
    <dl>
        <dt> <a href = "practice/practice.html">Practice </a></dt>
        <dd> Just some space for me to throw things against the wall, see what it looks like</dd>

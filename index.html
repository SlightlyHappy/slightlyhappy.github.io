    <h1> Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p> Hi, my name is SlightlyHappy - you can find me using this username on most major platforms - playstation, twitch, tiktok, steam, epic games, pretty much any platform. </p>
    <p> On this website - very generously hosted by GitHub - I plan to have a personal blog, upload my resume, and showcase some of my projects. <hr> Please note, I will be updating this website as much as I can</hr></p>

        <dd> Just my resume so far, though I don't believe it encompasses all my skills and experiences besides what my work would demonstrate.</dd>

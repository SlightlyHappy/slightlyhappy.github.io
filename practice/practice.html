<p> I kinda want to test out different headings first</p>
<h1> Blah </h1> <h2> Blah </h2><h3>Blah</h3><h4>Blah</h4><h5>Blah</h5><h6>Blah</h6>
<p> Now if I want to go back to the index/home page: <a href = "../index.html"> go home page</a></p>
<p> <b>Why am I doing this?</b> I don't really know... but I like it so far, and just to have an unordered list on the site:<ul>
    <li> To learn</li>
    <li> To showcase my portfolio</li>
    <li> To become a truly multi-faceted person?</li>
    <li> Oh, and to be self-sufficient. <i>Prepping for doomsday ig</i></li>
</ul></p>

<p> Ok, this being the practice page, I want to pretty much destroy the formatting of this page. <br> By that I mean that I don't really care if the page is in a coherant format </br></p>
<p> I used to be an avid photographer, haven't really practised much - but I think I will add a subsection to the website to upload some photographs whenever I can. Or maybe just to have a little blog of my own.</p>

<body> 
<p> I kinda want to test out different headings first</p>
<h1> Blah </h1> <h2> Blah </h2><h3>Blah</h3><h4>Blah</h4><h5>Blah</h5><h6>Blah</h6>
<p> Now if I want to go back to the index/home page: <a href = "../index.html"> go home page</a></p>
<p> <b>Why am I doing this?</b> I don't really know... but I like it so far, and just to have an unordered list on the site:<ul>
    <li> To learn</li>
    <li> To showcase my portfolio</li>
    <li> To become a truly multi-faceted person?</li>
    <li> Oh, and to be self-sufficient. <i>Prepping for doomsday ig</i></li>
</ul></p>

<p> Ok, this being the practice page, I want to pretty much destroy the formatting of this page. <br> By that I mean that I don't really care if the page is in a coherant format </br></p>
<p> I used to be an avid photographer, haven't really practiced much - but I think I will add a subsection to the website to upload some photographs whenever I can. Or maybe just to have a little blog of my own. <br> Let us start by uploading photographs that I found first, 
    like I said I need to practice a bit more  before I feel ok showing that part of my work to the world </br></p>
<p> So, a couple of days later - today is the 5th of August. Still haven't heard from the colleges I applied to for my master's. But that is ok, cus fuck it we ball <br>
so for this session of learning/practice, I want to focus on formatting images</br></p>
<p> I am going to use an image of a donut mainly because I started learning blender at one point watching <a href = "https://www.blenderguru.com/" > blender-gurus videos</a></p>
<p> Lets use every image tool I know of on this one image. I'll also write the code for the changes in plain so that I get practice/for my reference. </p>
<hr/>
<p> First the size of the image, and adding an alt description plus title</p>
<img src = "https://github.com/SlightlyHappy/slightlyhappy.github.io/blob/master/images/donutpractice.JPG?raw=true" alt="a very tasty donut?" title="a donut" width = "600" height = "450" />
<p> Now, lets start with the positioning of the donut.</p>
<img src="https://github.com/SlightlyHappy/slightlyhappy.github.io/blob/master/images/donutpractice.JPG?raw=true" alt="another equally tasty donut?" title ="its not the same donut" width = "100" height = "100"/>
<p> This is the second donut, you'll notice that it is a little smaller in size. But it's one of those European donuts - it's smaller cus people don't really want to get fat.</p>
<hr/>
<p> <img src="https://github.com/SlightlyHappy/slightlyhappy.github.io/blob/master/images/donutpractice.JPG?raw=true" alt="another equally tasty donut?" title ="its not the same donut" width = "100" height = "100"/> Notice that this European donut is at the beginning of this paragraph this is because the img attribute is contained within the paragraph attribute for this page.</p>
<hr/>
<p> Now this little donut will be right <img src="https://github.com/SlightlyHappy/slightlyhappy.github.io/blob/master/images/donutpractice.JPG?raw=true" alt="another equally tasty donut?" title ="its not the same donut" width = "100" height = "100"/> in the middle of this paragraph. I don't know why this donut wanted to be in the middle of this paragraph, but it is there.</p>
<hr/>
<p> Alignment, alright, now we come down to the (not so juicy) but juicy part of editing a website. (this was sarcasm by the way - elon really needs to invent his BMI so that I can have crystallized knowledge ready at hand whenver I need it smh</p>
<hr/>
<p> <img src = "https://github.com/SlightlyHappy/slightlyhappy.github.io/blob/master/images/donutpractice.JPG?raw=true"  width = "100" height = "150" align="left"/><figcaption> This is a special donut, don't eat my special donut because it is my special donut. Fuck off don't even think about it. this is the figcaption btw - note to self; a figcaption does not work well with align attribute.</figcaption> align the image left first. This image should be aligned left, blah blah blah, donuts are tasty etc etc. Imma just throw in a figcaption for the left aligned image to (1) practice and (2) practice (smh)</p>
<p> <img src = "https://github.com/SlightlyHappy/slightlyhappy.github.io/blob/master/images/donutpractice.JPG?raw=true"  width = "100" height = "150" align="right"/> And this image should be aligned right, I have been copy pasting the same image back to back for each of these trials. You know what changing the source for all these images is going to be a pain on github. I think there might be a better way to include/manipute the source/host my images on some website, or host my website. I think I will just link the next few images I use to some random linked images on the internet. That way I can have something to talk about as well. I hope I won't be breaking any copyright law. </p>
<hr/>
<p> ok, so i get it - alignmnet woo. There are three more ways to align an image. Top, bottom and middle. Using the same syntax. You'll figure it out when you need it.</p>
<br/>
<p> cool that was that, pretty much all the commands (main ones) for image manipulation in an HTML documnet, some other things I can experiment with is transparency and what layer the image is on. Though that might be part of CSS. That's for later though. lets commit this to github and change the image src urls</p>
<br/>
<h4> OK, NO MORE IMAGES FROM THE FLODER ITSELF  - IT IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH AND CAUSES ISSUES WHEN COMMITING CHANGES</h4>
<br/>
<p> Ok, so, I think I know enough to fix up my other pages on this website a bit... I also don't really have an interest in learning about tables on html, considering that there are other ways to edit and work on tables. <br/> also practicing div blocks, iframes, and other block elements like flash, audio and video is a lot to work on lol <br/> so for now I will work on making the other pages a little more felshed out, and on learning css.</p>
